#### Code Blocks

Code blocks are essential for technical blogs. Below is a JavaScript code sample with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// A simple function to greet a user
function greet(user) {
  if (user) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}! Welcome to our site.`);
  } else {
    console.log('Hello, guest!');
  }
}

const myUser = {
  name: "Alex",
  age: 28
};

greet(myUser);
```

#### Tables

Table alignment also needs to be tested.

| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Apple | üçé | $1.00 |
| Banana | üçå | $0.50 |
| Orange | üçä | $0.80 |
